# Created by Ryan Hanson
This project was created for CS365
For this assignment, I was asked to create a "shell" that can take input of up to 16 piped commands in C.
# To Run:
- Open a terminal session in this directory
- Run `gcc -c pipe.c redirect.c shell.c`
- Run `gcc shell.o pipe.o redirect.o -o shell`
- Run `./shell` and you're good to go!
